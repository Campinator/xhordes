# XHordes
## A modded version of the Hordes.io client to provide helpful features

### Installation
Installation is relatively simple.

Depending on your browser (Chrome or Firefox) you'll either need to install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) for Google Chrome, or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Mozilla Firefox as well as AdBlock Plus for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb?hl=en-US) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/?src=ss)


Go ahead and click [here](https://github.com/LegusX/xhordes/raw/master/XHordes.user.js) to install XHordes. Your userscript manager should then prompt you about installing XHordes. If you accept it, the userscript manager should install XHordes.

The last thing you need to do is to disable the original client code for Hordes so that XHordes can replace it. 
1. click on the Adblock Plus icon which should have appeared in the extension bar of your browser. 
2. Click on the button at the bottom that says "Options"
3. Click on the tab "Add your own filters"
4. In the text box type/paste in "hordes.io/script/dist.min.js" (without the quotes)
5. Click "Add Filter"

And you're done! You can now go to Hordes and check it out!
